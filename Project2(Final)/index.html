                        <p>Hello everyone who might be seeing my CSIT 121 final project. My Name is Abdulla Butt and I am an IT major. <br><br> For My final Project I took all the labs I did for my CSIT 121 class and merged them together into an ePorfolio using HTML and CSS. I wanted to do this even if it wasn't as our final lab just so I could have it to look back on and to see the growth this course had on me. <br><br> The labs we did in class were all small lessons to end with a final polished result. We started off with typing out a simple receipe for our favourite dish and then with each passing lab we learned something new in html and added to the website. Finally having a nice, clean, and somewhat professional website at the end. <br><br> For anyone who might be interested here is a schedule of the course material for my class.</p>
