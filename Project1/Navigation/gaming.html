		<p>Gaming had always been a big part of my life. When I was young my dad would bring me gaming devices such as psps, tablets, laptops, etc from other countries when he would visit. Later down it became and addiction, but I can proudly say that now I have control over my urge of gaming. Now I only game when I have free time or when I want to play with some friends, not countless hours just because I'm bored.</p>
